# TestMe
Starting 2022, I want to build a framework to build backend services - with a nice user interface.
If possible, we can build a command line interface to create/update/run test cases
As I a familiar with spring-boot, I would like to use kotlin with spring-boot 2.2+
For the front end, I would like to use flutter for web. If that does not work, I can switch back to Angulare 12+.



backend relational DB to store the test cases, test runs, and user details.
Authentication - Oath2?


Features,

Backend:
Rest APIs to call backend servies (REST/ASF/etc.)
Rest APIs to create/read/update/delete test cases
API to run a list of test cases (1 or more testcases)
   each test run data will be stored and kept for a certain number of days.
   
Frontend:
Create a test case - add tags
